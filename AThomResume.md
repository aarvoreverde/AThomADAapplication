Experience
----------

**Civil Engineer II**  
I work at a Civil Engineering Consulting firm as a designer on large scale infrastructure projects. My experience spans all phases of design from preliminary engineering through final design. I work on engineering design, 2D and 3D modelling, writing technical reports, technical specifications, and request for proposal documentation.

**Research Associate**  
During my Junior and Senior years I worked at the Institute for Complex Additive Systems Analysis; part time during the semester, and full time during winter and summer breaks. I worked on multiple research projects related to infrastructure systems. The federal Department of Energy funded the most prominent project, a partnership with the University of Hawaii, with a $500,000 grant. My research included modeling the impact of renewable resources on the electrical grid.

**Research Associate**  
During the summer break of my senior year, I worked on a Critical Infrastructure Seismic Assesment for the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management. I assessed potential seismic effects on the State of New Mexico's critical infrastructure. The resulting technical report was distributed statewide to emergency managers as a resource for natural disaster preparation.

**Transportation You Mentor**  
I volunteer as a mentor for the Transportation You Program. Once a month I visit a local high school and meet with a group of young women who are interested in pursuing STEM related studies. We have lunch, and participate in activities which introduce different roles/ careers in transportation. 

**Future City Speaker and Judge**  
I was invited to speak about Transportation Design to participants of the Regional Future City Competition. The theme was "Tomorrow’s Transit: Design a way to move people in and around your city.” 

**Womens Transportation Seminar**  
WTS is an international organization dedicated to building the future of transportation through the global advancement of women. I serve on the board of the Puget Sound Chapter of WTS as Co-chair of Programs, Diversity, and the Annual Fundraising Gala.
